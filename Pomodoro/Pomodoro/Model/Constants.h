#define kAboutDescription1 @"The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. These intervals are known as \"pomodori\", the plural of the Italian word pomodoro for \"tomato\". The method is based on the idea that frequent breaks can improve mental agility. (wikipedia.com)"

#define kAboutDescription2 @"For many people, time is an enemy. We race against the clock to finish assignments and meet deadlines. The Pomodoro Technique teaches you to work with time, instead of struggling against it. A revolutionary time management system, it is at once deceptively simple to learn and life-changing to use.(pomodorotechnique.com)"

#define kAboutDescription3 @"The Pomodoro Technique can help you power through distractions, hyper-focus, and get things done in short bursts, while taking frequent breaks to come up for air and relax. Best of all, it's easy. If you have a busy job where you're expected to produce, it's a great way to get through your tasks.(lifehacker.com)"

#define kAboutDescription4 @"The Pomodoro Technique was invented in the early 90s by developer, entrepeneur, and author Francesco Cirillo. Cirillo named the system \"Pomodoro\" after the tomato-shaped timer he used to track his work as a university student. The methodology is simple: When faced with any large task or series of tasks, break the work down into short, timed intervals (called \"Pomodoros\") that are spaced out by short breaks.(lifehacker.com)"

#define kAboutDescription5 @"Essential to the Pomodoro Technique is the notion that taking short, scheduled breaks while working eliminates the “running on fumes” feeling you get when you’ve pushed yourself too hard. It’s impossible to over work when you stick to the system. You may end up taking fewer sick days, too!(pomodorotechnique.com)"

#define kAboutDescription6 @"Whether it’s a call, a Facebook message, or suddenly realizing you need to change the oil in your car, many distracting thoughts and events come up when you’re at work. The Pomodoro Technique will help you log your distractions and order them according to priority levels. Often, they can wait.(pomodorotechnique.com)"

#define kAboutDescription7 @"Most of us are intimately acquainted with the guilt that comes from procrastinating. If we haven’t had a productive day, it’s pretty easy to end up feeling like we can’t enjoy our free time. Becoming a Pomodoro Master involves creating an effective timetable, allowing you to truly enjoy your time off.(pomodorotechnique.com)"
